# HerokuToDiscord
A simple NodeJS app to send any heroku webhooks to discord. Deploy this to any npm hosting server, set the URL in heroku to this application and watch the magic happen. You will need to have a Discord server to recieve the webhooks, a channel with a webhook created, and to copy the webhook link and past it in a copy of .env.local.example that was renamed to .env.local.
